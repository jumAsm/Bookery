## <img src="bookery_icon.jpg" alt="Bookery Icon" width="30"/> Bookery – Comprehensive Book Marketplace
Bookery is a robust mobile application developed from scratch using the Flutter framework for the Software Process Models (SW315) course at the University of Jeddah. It serves as an all-in-one platform for book enthusiasts to organize their personal collections and engage in a community-driven marketplace.

About the App
Bookery addresses the challenges of managing large personal libraries and the lack of dedicated platforms for sharing or trading books within a community.
With Bookery, users can:
Personal Library Management: Add books to a collection and track reading progress with statuses like Reading or Completed.
Community Marketplace: Buy and sell books by listing details such as price and condition.
Intelligent Recommendations: Discover new titles through an algorithmic system that analyzes user preferences and reading history.
Advanced Search: Filter the collection or marketplace by title, author, genre, or publication year.
Rate & Favorite: Submit 1-to-5 star ratings for completed books and mark specific titles as favorites for quick access.
External Data Integration: Automatically fetch detailed book information from external databases.

Software Engineering Process
The project followed an Agile methodology, documented through three distinct Sprints:
Sprint 0: Focused on problem definition, requirement engineering (Functional/Non-Functional), and architectural modeling.
Sprint 1: Implemented core Marketplace functions, including "Add new book for sale" and "Buy a book".
Sprint 2: Developed Personal Library management, status tracking, and the favorites system.
Sprint 3: Finalized search functionality and the recommendation engine.
