**Bookery** is a robust Flutter-based mobile application developed as a semester project for the **Software Process Models (SW315)** course at the **University of Jeddah**. It serves as an all-in-one platform for book enthusiasts to manage personal collections and engage in a community-driven marketplace.

### About the App

Bookery was designed to bridge the gap between personal library management and community trading:

With Bookery, users can:

- **Manage Personal Library:** Track reading progress with statuses (`Reading`, `Completed`).
- **Community Marketplace:** Buy and sell books with details on price and condition.
- **Intelligent Recommendations:** Discover books via a preference-based algorithm.
- **Advanced Search:** Filter by title, author, genre, or year.
- **Rate & Favorite:** Submit 1-5 star ratings and bookmark favorite titles.
- **Data Integration:** Automatically fetch book details from external APIs.
